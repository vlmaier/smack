# smack-chat

It's a demo app project which was created during the Udemy course [Kotlin for Android: Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/devslopes-android-kotlin/).
The app itself is a chat application. During the course and the development of this application I was able to learn about web requests and API communication, hosting API, user management, broadcast receivers and sockets.
